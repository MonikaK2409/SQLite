# SQLite
I was assigned to explore SQLite, I went through the official documentation and gained theoritical knowledge and in the pace to explore all its features practically.
## Introduction
SQLite is a lightweight, embedded relational database engine.
It is self-contained, serverless, and requires minimal configuration, making it easy to deploy and use in various applications.

## Features
- **Zero Configuration**: SQLite does not require any setup or administration, making it suitable for small to medium-sized projects.
- **Cross-Platform**: SQLite is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **ACID Transactions**: SQLite supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Small Footprint**: The SQLite library is compact, with a small memory and disk space footprint, making it ideal for embedded systems and mobile applications.
- **Wide Language Support**: SQLite supports multiple programming languages, including C/C++, Python, Java, and many others.

After exploring I set up sqlite in the system using few linux commands ([Reference](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-sqlite-on-ubuntu-20-04))
