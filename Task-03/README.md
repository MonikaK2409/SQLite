## Overview of Task-03 
- operation.py script has 2 functions. The first one is measuring the performance of SQLite in insertion, the next one is reverse delete.
- For measuring the performance I have used tuples of different sizes and measured the time taken for insertion then plotted a graph accordingly.
- For Reverse delete operation I asked user for input of tuple whose reverse is supposed to be deleted. Then a search for the reverse tuple takes places and that tuple is deleted.

## Results for performance of SQLite in Insertion
![insertiontime](https://github.com/MonikaK2409/SQLite/assets/142796975/ddabebf0-72fe-459a-964d-70c40f245609)

## Changes Suggested
- To measure performance of more insertion values (1,00,000 and 10,00,000 tuples).
- To follow the same with respect to updation and deletion.

## Observation
- Through the graph plotted its concluded that the performance of SQLite in insertion varries exponentially.
